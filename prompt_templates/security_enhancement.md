# Security Enhancement Epic

Develop a comprehensive list of tasks to bolster the security of our Python application. Consider aspects such as conducting security audits, implementing secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, enhancing authentication and authorization, data encryption, penetration testing, security monitoring and logging, secure API practices, incident response planning, and security training for the team. The goal is to create a robust security posture that protects the application, its data, and its users from potential threats and vulnerabilities.
