# Testing Strategy Improvement Epic

Develop a comprehensive list of tasks to enhance our testing strategy for the Python project. Consider various testing approaches such as unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, behavior-driven development, property-based testing, performance testing, security testing, test-driven development, mutation testing, and continuous testing in the CI/CD pipeline. The goal is to create a robust testing framework that ensures code reliability, catches bugs early, and improves overall software quality.
