# Documentation Overhaul Epic

Create a detailed task list for improving and maintaining documentation for our Python project. Consider aspects such as auditing existing documentation, implementing style guides, enhancing inline code comments, creating comprehensive API docs, developing user guides and tutorials, automating documentation generation, version control for docs, architecture and design documentation, contribution guidelines, and establishing regular review processes. The goal is to create clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date documentation that enhances project understanding, facilitates onboarding, and improves overall code maintainability.
