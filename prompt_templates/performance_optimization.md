# Performance Optimization Epic

Create a detailed task list for optimizing the performance of our Python application. Consider aspects such as application profiling, database query optimization, caching strategies, CPU and memory usage improvements, asynchronous processing, network and API optimization, load balancing and scaling, front-end performance (if applicable), and setting up performance monitoring. The goal is to significantly improve the application's speed, responsiveness, and resource utilization, enhancing user experience and reducing operational costs.
