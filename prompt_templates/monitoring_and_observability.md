Create a detailed task list for implementing comprehensive monitoring and observability in our Python application. Consider aspects such as logging frameworks, centralized log management, application performance monitoring, real-time alerting, distributed tracing, custom metrics and dashboards, error tracking, user behavior analytics, infrastructure monitoring, and incident response procedures. The goal is to gain deep insights into the application's behavior, performance, and user experience, enabling proactive issue resolution and informed decision-making.
