# Dependency Management Epic

Generate a list of tasks to improve dependency management in our Python project. Consider aspects such as auditing current dependencies, implementing modern dependency management tools, automating updates, vulnerability scanning, managing transitive dependencies, vendoring critical dependencies, setting up private repositories if needed, establishing guidelines for new dependencies, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and regular maintenance. The goal is to create a more secure, efficient, and maintainable dependency management process that reduces potential risks and improves project stability.
