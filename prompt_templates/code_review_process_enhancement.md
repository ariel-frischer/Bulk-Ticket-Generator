# Code Review Process Enhancement Epic

Develop a comprehensive list of tasks to improve our code review process. Consider aspects such as establishing clear guidelines, implementing automated review tools, creating pull request templates, defining roles and responsibilities, implementing checklists, incorporating pair programming, establishing effectiveness metrics, addressing technical debt, providing training on review techniques, and regularly updating the process. The goal is to create a more efficient, thorough, and collaborative code review culture that enhances code quality and knowledge sharing within the team.
